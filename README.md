# Urho3D-AIDE
This is a sample project that can be used to build Urho3D using Android-IDE.
The setup is simple and easy to use.
Just clone it and use.

Before the example can run, you must download the binaries and resources.
You can find them at https://sourceforge.net/projects/urho3d/files/Urho3D/

The Android.mk uses a custom c++_shared because as of now, the AIDE c++_shared
stl build is kinda wacky. Maybe, later when it is fixed, I will change that.
